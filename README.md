## 📈 Data Science/Analysis

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| 📉 [Stocks Price Analysis](https://github.com/Usama-Imtiaz-07/Storck-Price-Analysis) | Sept 2024 | Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Yfinance, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy | This project is a Streamlit-based web application that provides real-time insights into the S&P 500 stock market. The app retrieves the list of S&P 500 companies from Wikipedia and fetches their year-to-date stock closing prices using the yfinance library. Users can filter companies by sector, visualize stock price trends, and download the data for further analysis. |
| 📈 [Regression Analysis (Cardiac Arrest Risk Prediction)](https://github.com/Usama-Imtiaz-07/Cardiac-Arrest-Prediction) | May 2024 | Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Logistic regression, Neural Networks (CNN's) | This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of cardiac arrest based on health indicators using two machine learning approaches: Logistic Regression and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The dataset used is the Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset (BRFSS 2015), which contains over 250,000 records with 22 health-related features. The goal is to build and evaluate models that can accurately classify individuals at risk of cardiac arrest. |
| 🏥 [Data Driven Health Analysis](https://github.com/Usama-Imtiaz-07/Data-Driven-Health-Analysis) | Nov 2023 | EDA, Statistics, Tableau | This project focuses on analyzing global health trends related to Body Mass Index (BMI), Diabetes Prevalence, and Raised Blood Pressure across different countries, years, and genders. The analysis was conducted using Tableau to create interactive visualizations that uncover patterns and relationships in the data. |
| 🦠 [Water Contamination and Wildlife Impact](https://github.com/Usama-Imtiaz-07/Visual-analytics-of-water-contamination-and-its-impact-on-wildlife) | Dec 2023 | EDA, Python, Altair, Excel, Statistics, Tableau | This project focuses on analyzing water contamination trends in the Boonsong Lekagul Wildlife Preserve and their potential impact on the endangered Rose-Crested Blue Pipit bird species. |
| 🏀 [Player Statistics (NBA)](https://github.com/Usama-Imtiaz-07/EDA_NBA_Player_Stats) | Oct 2024 | Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, base64. | This project is a Streamlit-based web application that provides insights into NBA player statistics from 1950 to 2020. The app scrapes player stats data from Basketball Reference and allows users to filter and analyze player statistics by year, team, and position. Users can also visualize correlations between statistical categories and download the filtered data for further analysis. |

## 📖 Natural Language Processing (Language Models)

| Project Link | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|
| 🗣️ [Speech Recognition and Sentiment Feedback](https://github.com/Usama-Imtiaz-07/ASR-Sentiment-and-Speech-Feedback-System) | Python, Huggiface, Transformers, Pytorch, W&B, WHisperAI LLM (ASR), BERT LLM (Sentiment) | This project combines Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Sentiment Analysis, and Speech Feedback to create a system that transcribes spoken language, analyzes sentiment, and provides actionable feedback based on the transcription and sentiment. | 
| 🙋‍♂️ [Keyword Name Classifier](https://github.com/Usama-Imtiaz-07/Key-Word-Name-Classifier/blob/main/main.ipynb) | PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, Glob, OS, RNN | This project is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based language classifier that predicts the language of origin for a given name. The model is trained on a dataset of names from 18 different languages, including Arabic, Chinese, English, French, and more. The project involves data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation, along with visualization of results and user interaction for predictions. |
